Overview of digital wallets available to send, spend, and earn Celo assets.

## Choosing a Wallet

Wallets are tools that create accounts, manage keys, and help users transact on the Celo network.

It's important to be careful when choosing a wallet because they manage your secret account keys. You should only use reputable wallets that are well maintained by organizations/people that you trust.

## Celo Native Wallets

<!-- ### Valora

Valora is a mobile wallet focused on making global peer-to-peer payments simple and accessible to anyone. It supports the Celo Identity Protocol which allows users to verify their phone number and send payments to their contacts.

## Celo Compatible Wallets

There are currently a few other compatible wallets. When the upcoming [Donut hard-fork](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/issues/94) is live, Celo transactions will become compatible with Ethereum transactions. This will allow some Ethereum wallets to work with Celo. More updates on this coming soon.

### Metamask

You can learn more about connecting Metamask to the Celo network [here](/tools/wallets/Metamask/use).

### Wallet Connect

Strictly speaking, wallet connect is not a wallet; it is an open protocol for connecting wallets to Dapps. Celo wallets are implementing Wallet Connect version 2, so dapp developers should use V2 as well.
