# Oracles on Celo

This page provides a comprehensive list of oracles operating on the Celo network.

Oracles are critical components in blockchain ecosystems, serving as bridges that connect on-chain smart contracts with real-world data. They enable smart contracts to access external information, such as financial market data, weather conditions, or other off-chain events. This functionality is essential because blockchains, by design, cannot directly access external data due to their isolated nature.

Below is a list of all on-chain oracles:

- [Band Protocol](/tools/oracles/band-protocol)
- [RedStone Oracles](/tools/oracles/redstone)
- [Supra](https://supraoracles.com/)
- [Chainlink Price Feed Oracles](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=celo)
- [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/)
