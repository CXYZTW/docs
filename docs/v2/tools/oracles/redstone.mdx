By the conclusion of this tutorial, you will have a thorough understanding of how to integrate your decentralized application (dApp) built on Celo with RedStone oracles.

This document will cover:

- Overview of RedStone
- Integration with RedStone
- Practical Examples

## üöÄ Overview of RedStone

RedStone is a data ecosystem that provides fast and accurate financial information in a decentralized manner through an innovative on-demand data fetching approach.

RedStone offers a unique design of Oracles tailored to meet the requirements of modern DeFi protocols.

- Utilizes the Arweave blockchain for cost-effective and permanent storage
- Employs token incentives to encourage data providers to maintain data integrity and uninterrupted service
- Uses signed meta-transactions to deliver prices on-chain
- Although data is stored on the Arweave chain, it can be utilized with any other blockchain

For more detailed information about the RedStone protocol, please refer to the [RedStone compiled documentation.](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-node/blob/main/docs/COMPILED_ORACLE_DOCS.md)

## üìà Available Data

Thanks to our innovative architecture, we offer over a thousand pricing data feeds, including tokens, stocks, ETFs, commodities, and more, at a fraction of the cost of traditional Oracle integrations.

You can explore available assets and data providers on [app.redstone.finance.](https://app.redstone.finance/)

## üî• Integration with RedStone

**IMPORTANT**: RedStone contracts are currently undergoing a security audit, and we are enhancing our infrastructure security. Therefore, before using RedStone oracles in production dApps, please contact us [on Discord.](https://redstone.finance/discord) We are happy to assist with the integration and can set up a new pool of data provider nodes if necessary.

Please review this [short documentation](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-evm-connector/blob/master/README.md) to learn how to integrate your dApp with RedStone oracles.

üí° Note: Currently, RedStone is integrated only with the `ethers.js` library. To use it in Celo blockchain dApps, you should use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) along with [@celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper).
