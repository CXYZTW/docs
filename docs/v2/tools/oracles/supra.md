## What is Supra?

[Supra](https://supraoracles.com) delivers decentralized oracle price feeds suitable for both on-chain and off-chain applications, such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payment systems. Supra’s oracle chain and consensus algorithm ensure the fastest finality times, backed by layer-1 security guarantees. The pull oracle boasts a sub-second response time. In addition to speed and security, Supra’s rotating node architecture aggregates data from over 40 sources, employing a robust calculation methodology to ensure the highest accuracy. The data dashboard’s node provenance feature offers a fully transparent historical audit trail. Notably, Supra’s Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) paper was accepted at ICDCS 2023, the oldest conference on distributed systems.
