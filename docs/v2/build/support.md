# Support


We are trying our best to provide the most coherent and complete docs, but we understand that we might not yet have everything that you are looking for. 

## Where to reach out?

<ColoredText>[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/celo)</ColoredText> is the best place to reach out with any questions regarding building and support. Make sure to claim the developer role and out moderators will make sure to provide guidance and answers.

We also invite you to check out our repositories on <ColoredText>[GitHub](https://github.com/celo-org)</ColoredText>, create issues and open discussion in the <ColoredText>[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/celo-org/discussions)</ColoredText>.

For updates make sure to sign up to <ColoredText>[Celo Signal Mailing List](https://share.hsforms.com/1Qrhush1vSA2WIamd_yL4ow53n4j)</ColoredText> and follow CeloDevs on <ColoredText>[Twitter](https://x.com/CeloDevs)</ColoredText>.
