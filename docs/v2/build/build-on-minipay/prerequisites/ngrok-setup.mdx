import ColoredText from '/src/components/ColoredText';

When building dApps for MiniPay <ColoredText> locally</ColoredText>, you want to <ColoredText>test the dApp</ColoredText> inside MiniPay wallet on your phone.

But since the dApp is running locally, you <ColoredText>cannot simply visit localhost</ColoredText> on your phone to open the dApp on your phone.

To solve this, we use `ngrok`.

`ngrok` allows us to <ColoredText>share our localhost</ColoredText> by providing us with a temporary web url that can be used on any device!

## Installing Ngrok

1. Visit [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)

![ngrok.com](/img/build/build-on-minipay/prerequisites/ngrok-setup/1.png)

2. Sign up

![sign up ngrok](/img/build/build-on-minipay/prerequisites/ngrok-setup/2.png)

3. The dashboard will have instructions based on your OS on how to install and use ngrok!

4. Once installed you can use the following <ColoredText>command</ColoredText> to <ColoredText>share your localhost port</ColoredText>.

```bash
> ngrok http [PORT]
```

The output looks something like this.

You can use the <ColoredText>highlighted URL</ColoredText> to launch the localhost dApp on the [MiniPay's Site Tester](http://docs.celo.org/developer/build-on-minipay/overview#test-your-dapp-inside-minipay).
