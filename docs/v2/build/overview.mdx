## Building dApps on Celo

Welcome to the Celo developer documentation!

Celo is an Ethereum Layer 2 network designed to scale Ethereum using the OP Stack, becoming part of the growing Superchain ecosystem.

If youâ€™re experienced in building on Ethereum, your code, dependencies, and tooling will work seamlessly on Celo. Our network is fully compatible with EVM bytecode, making the development experience feel just like building on Ethereum, but with enhanced scalability and lower costs.
