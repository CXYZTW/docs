# Celo L2 Testnets

As part of the transition to a L2, Celo has been operating two Layer 2 testnets: Dango, which was live form July till September 2024, and Alfajores, which was upgraded to Layer 2 on the [26th of September 2024](https://forum.celo.org/t/alfajores-goes-l2/9052).

:::warning
With Alfajores L2 being live, **transactions from Dango will not be synced to Alfajores L2**. Testnets are for testing and experimentation. Tokens have no real-world value, and you may encounter bugs and limitations.

## Alfajores L2 Upgrade

The Alfajores testnet was upgraded to a [Layer 2](https://forum.celo.org/t/alfajores-goes-l2/9052) on the 26th of September 2024. This upgrade will transition Alfajores into the Celo Layer 2 environment, allowing developers and integrators to start building and testing with the new infrastructure. This is a key step in Celo’s broader evolution, paving the way for future upgrades to the Baklava testnet and the mainnet.


#### Key features of Alfajores L2 include:

- Full Alfajores history and state
- CELO token duality (ability to use CELO natively and as an ERC20 token)
- [Fee abstraction](../tools/fee-abstraction.md) (ability to pay for gas with tokens)
- Native Bridging to and from the L1
- Data Availability via EigenDA
- Staking
- Ultragreen Money


## Dango Testnet - not live anymore

The [Dango Testnet](https://forum.celo.org/t/introducing-dango-l2-celo-testnet/8313) was announced on the 7th of July 2024, Celo’s first Layer 2 public test network. Dango allows developers and infrastructure providers to familiarize themselves with the Layer 2 environment. On the 26th of September 2024, when Alfajores L2 went live, it was shut down and the transactions from Dango weren't  synced to Alfajores L2.
