# About Celo L2

Celo is transitioning from a standalone EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. This shift, [proposed by cLabs in July 2023](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109), aims to maintain the seamless user experience that Celo is known for—characterized by speed, low costs, and ease of use—while leveraging Ethereum’s security and ecosystem.

:::warning
While most applications should remain unaffected, <ColoredText>node operators, validators, and RPC providers</ColoredText> must ensure their systems are prepared for the transition to maintain seamless operations.

## What does this mean for our ecosystem?

Celo's evolution from an <ColoredText>L1 EVM-compatible chain to an L2 solution</ColoredText> marks a significant milestone in our ongoing relationship with the Ethereum ecosystem. As an L1 chain, Celo has always maintained close ties with Ethereum, sharing its commitment to decentralization, security, and innovation. By transitioning to an L2, Celo strengthens this bond, allowing our developers and protocols to immerse themselves even deeper into the <ColoredText>vibrant, collaborative Ethereum community</ColoredText>. This integration enhances opportunities for <ColoredText>open-source contributions</ColoredText>, joint initiatives, and the development of <ColoredText>public goods</ColoredText>, ensuring that Celo's impact resonates widely across the blockchain space.

### Technical Changes

From a technical standpoint, this shift brings substantial benefits. <ColoredText>Native bridging</ColoredText> between Celo and Ethereum, which was previously not possible, will now be a reality. This advancement significantly enhances the security of token transfers by <ColoredText>reducing reliance on external bridges</ColoredText>, which have often been a point of vulnerability. With native bridging, Celo can offer a more <ColoredText>secure and streamlined experience</ColoredText> for users, ensuring that transactions within our ecosystem are both <ColoredText>safe and reliable</ColoredText>. In essence, becoming an L2 not only aligns Celo more closely with Ethereum's expansive network but also empowers our community to innovate with greater confidence and reach.
