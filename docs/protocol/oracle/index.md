# Oracles on Celo

This page provides a comprehensive list of oracles operating on the Celo network.

Oracles are critical components in blockchain ecosystems, serving as bridges that connect on-chain smart contracts with real-world data. They enable smart contracts to access external information, such as financial market data, weather conditions, or other off-chain events. This functionality is essential because blockchains, by design, cannot directly access external data due to their isolated nature.

Below is a list of all on-chain oracles:

- [Band Protocol](/protocol/oracle/band-protocol)
- [RedStone Oracles](/protocol/oracle/redstone)
- [Supra](https://supraoracles.com/)
- [Chainlink Price Feed Oracles](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=celo)
- [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/)

# Oracles on Celo

This page lists Oracles running on the Celo network. 

Oracles are essential components in blockchain ecosystems, acting as bridges that connect on-chain smart contracts with real-world data. They allow smart contracts to access information that exists outside the blockchain, such as financial market data, weather conditions, or other off-chain events. This capability is crucial because blockchains, by design, cannot access external data directly due to their isolated nature.

Here are lists of all on-chain Oracles:

- [Band Protocol](/protocol/oracle/band-protocol)
- [RedStone Oracles](/protocol/oracle/redstone)
- [Celo Reserve Oracles](/protocol/stability/oracles)
- [Supra](https://supraoracles.com/)
- [Chainlink, Price Feed Oracles](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=celo)
- [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/)
- [Witnet](https://witnet.io/)
